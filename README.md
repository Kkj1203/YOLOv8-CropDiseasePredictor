#🌱 YOLOv8 Crop Disease Detection System 🌾

This project implements a **deep learning–based crop disease detection pipeline** using **YOLOv8**, a modern real-time object detection model.  
It detects and classifies multiple crop leaf diseases from images and is suitable for academic projects, agricultural analytics, and applied computer vision use cases.

## 📌 Project Overview

Crop diseases can significantly reduce agricultural yield and quality. This system uses **computer vision and deep learning** to automatically detect crop diseases from leaf images.

### ✨ Key Features
- 🌿 Multi-class crop disease detection  
- ⚡ YOLOv8-based object detection  
- 🔁 End-to-end pipeline: dataset download → training → validation → inference  
- 📊 Visualisation of predictions and training metrics  
- ☁️ Runs seamlessly on Google Colab

## 📁 Dataset Structure

The dataset follows the standard **YOLO directory format**:
dataset/
├── train/
│ ├── images/
│ └── labels/
├── val/
│ ├── images/
│ └── labels/

## 📦 Install Required Libraries
pip install kaggle ultralytics

## 🔐 Configure Kaggle
mkdir -p ~/.kaggle
mv kaggle.json ~/.kaggle/
chmod 600 ~/.kaggle/kaggle.json

## ⬇️ Dataset Download
The dataset is downloaded directly from Kaggle and extracted locally:
kaggle datasets download -d <dataset-name>
unzip <dataset-name>.zip -d /content/dataset

A YAML configuration file defines dataset paths and class labels:
train: /content/dataset/train/images
val: /content/dataset/val/images
nc: <number_of_classes>
names: [class_1, class_2, ..., class_n]
This file is required by YOLOv8 during training and validation.

## ⚙️ Training Parameters
- 🕒 Epochs: 10  
- 🖼 Image Size: 640 × 640  
- 📦 Batch Size: 16  
- 🔄 Optimiser: Automatically selected by YOLOv8 

## 📊 Evaluation Metrics
- Precision
- Recall
- mAP@0.5
- mAP@0.5:0.95
These metrics measure detection accuracy and generalisation performance.

## 🔍 Inference & Prediction
results = model.predict(
    source='path/to/images',
    conf=0.5,
    save=True
)

- 🟦 Bounding boxes and class labels are drawn on images
